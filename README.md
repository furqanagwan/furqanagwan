# Furqan Agwan – Portfolio 🚀

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffurqanagwan%2Fportfolio)

Welcome to my personal portfolio and digital playground! This project is designed as a space to showcase my experience, skills, technical journey, and the things I’m most passionate about—whether that’s AI, DevOps, web engineering, fitness, or even a cheeky speedrun on Xbox.

## Purpose & Vision

- **Your first impression of me:**
  - This portfolio isn’t just a resume. It’s a living record of what I’m learning, building, and where I’m going next.
  - I wanted a platform to share my projects, write about my interests (tech, sports, fitness, gaming, AI), and connect with like-minded people and teams.
  - Clean, fast, modern, and a bit opinionated—just like the best codebases.
