        Hi, I’m Furqan, a software engineer based in Leicester, UK. I love
        working with technology and bringing new ideas to life through code.
        Outside of work, I’m passionate about fitness, sports, cooking, and
        exploring new places—whether that’s on holiday or a weekend adventure.
        I’m also a big fan of video games, movies, and TV shows, always looking
        for a great story or something fun to dive into.
