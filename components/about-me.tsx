        Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Furqan, a software
        engineer based in Leicester, UK. I love working with technology to
        design and build great systems and experiences. You’ll often find me
        prototyping ideas in code. When I’m not working, I like to cook, play
        video games, and sometimes enjoy a good book.
