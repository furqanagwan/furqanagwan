Negotiating your salary can feel uncomfortable, but it's one of the most impactful skills you can develop.

## Do Your Research

Before any negotiation, know your market value:
- Check levels.fyi and Glassdoor
- Talk to peers in similar roles
- Consider total compensation, not just base salary

## Key Negotiation Tactics

1. **Never give the first number** - Let them anchor
2. **Express enthusiasm first** - Then negotiate
3. **Get it in writing** - Verbal offers aren't final
4. **Consider the full package** - Stock, bonus, benefits

Remember: companies expect you to negotiate. Not doing so leaves money on the table.
