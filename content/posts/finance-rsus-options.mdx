Equity compensation is a major part of tech pay packages. Here's what you need to know.

## RSUs vs Stock Options

**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)**

- Granted shares that vest over time
- Less risky than options
- Taxed as ordinary income when vested

**Stock Options**

- Right to buy shares at a set price
- More upside potential, more risk
- ISO vs NSO tax implications

## Key Considerations

1. **Vesting Schedule** - Typically 4 years with 1-year cliff
2. **Tax Planning** - 83(b) elections, QSBS
3. **Diversification** - Don't over-concentrate
4. **Exercise Strategy** - When to exercise options

Consult a tax professional before making major equity decisions.
