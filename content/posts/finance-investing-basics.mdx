Tech professionals often have higher-than-average incomes but may lack financial literacy. Here's how to start building wealth.

## The Fundamentals

1. **Emergency Fund First** - 3-6 months of expenses
2. **Max Out 401(k) Match** - Free money from your employer
3. **Index Funds** - Low-cost, diversified investing
4. **Roth vs Traditional** - Understand tax implications

## Common Mistakes

- Holding too much company stock
- Timing the market instead of time IN the market
- Ignoring tax-advantaged accounts
- Lifestyle inflation

Start early, stay consistent, and let compound interest do the heavy lifting.
