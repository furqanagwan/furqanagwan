Poor ergonomics can lead to chronic pain. Set up your workspace correctly.

## The Essentials

### Monitor Position

- Top of screen at eye level
- Arm's length away
- Slight downward gaze

### Chair Setup

- Feet flat on floor
- Knees at 90 degrees
- Lumbar support engaged

### Keyboard & Mouse

- Elbows at 90 degrees
- Wrists neutral (not bent)
- Consider ergonomic alternatives

## Movement Breaks

- **20-20-20 Rule** - Every 20 min, look 20 ft away for 20 sec
- **Stand Regularly** - Alternate sitting/standing
- **Stretch Daily** - Neck, shoulders, wrists

Your body is your most important development tool. Protect it.
