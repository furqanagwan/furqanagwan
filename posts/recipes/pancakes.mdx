# Protein Pancakes

Start your morning with a stack that slaps—extra protein, fluffy vibes, zero guilt.

## Ingredients

- 1 scoop (30g) vanilla protein powder
- 1/2 cup (60g) oat flour (or blended oats)
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon (optional, but trust me)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) milk (any—dairy or plant-based)
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 mashed banana (for sweetness)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Cooking spray or a dab of oil/butter

## Preparation

1. **Mix Dry:** In a bowl, combine protein powder, oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
2. **Mix Wet:** In another bowl, whisk together milk, egg, mashed banana, and vanilla extract.
3. **Combine:** Pour wet into dry and mix just until combined (don’t overmix, unless you want chewy pancakes).
4. **Heat:** Preheat a non-stick pan on medium. Grease with spray or a little oil.

## Cooking

1. Pour batter onto the hot pan (about 1/4 cup per pancake).
2. Cook for 2–3 minutes until bubbles form on top, then flip.
3. Cook 1–2 minutes more, until golden and cooked through.

## Serving Suggestions

- Top with fresh berries, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, Greek yogurt, or a scoop of peanut butter.
- Add more protein by mixing in a spoonful of Greek yogurt into the batter.
- Stack, flex, enjoy.
