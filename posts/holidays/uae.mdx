# Dubai: Skyscrapers, Souqs & Desert Vibes

From futuristic skylines to old-school markets and the wildest brunches, Dubai is next-level.

## 🏙️ Burj Khalifa & Downtown

- Went to the **top of Burj Khalifa** – 148 floors up, sky-high views. Wild.
- The Dubai Fountain show? Literally TikTok material.
- Got lost in Dubai Mall (which is bigger than some countries, not even joking).

## 🏝️ Palm Jumeirah & The Beach Life

- Took the monorail down the Palm.
- Snapped pics at Atlantis. No dolphins, but loads of influencers.
- **JBR Beach:** Jet-skis, camel rides, and golden sunsets.

## 🐪 Desert Safari

- 4x4 dune bashing (better than any roller coaster).
- Rode a camel – 10/10, would ride again.
- Watched the sunset, tried sandboarding, ate BBQ under the stars.

## 🛍️ Old Dubai: Souqs & Culture

- Wandered through **Gold Souk** and **Spice Souk** – so many smells, so much gold.
- Took an abra boat across Dubai Creek.
- Ate the best shawarma in Deira, hands down.

## 🍽️ Food Scene

- **Shawarma & Karak:** Life essentials.
- Tried “camel burger.” No notes, just vibes.
- Brunched at a rooftop. The views are as extra as the bill.

## 💡 Dubai Tips

- Dress cool, but respectful (especially in malls/old Dubai).
- Metro is cheap and easy. Taxis have A/C, thank god.
- Stay hydrated – it’s toasty, even in “winter.”
