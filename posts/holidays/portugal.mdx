# Lisbon: Pastel de Nata, City Hills & Sunsets

Lisbon’s got flavor, color, and more stairs than a gym. Here’s how I did it all (with pastry breaks).

## 🏰 Alfama & Old Town

- Wandered through the twisty Alfama streets, found Fado music echoing from windows.
- Climbed to **São Jorge Castle** – views for days.
- Trams everywhere, including the Instagram-famous **Tram 28**.

## 🌉 Waterfront Vibes

- Walked under the **Ponte 25 de Abril** bridge (looks like San Francisco, feels like Portugal).
- Chilled at **Time Out Market**—food from all over, but always ended up with pastel de nata.

## 🥧 Food Diaries

- Ate _way_ too many pastel de nata (those mini custard pies are elite).
- Seafood game is strong. Grilled sardines, octopus rice, and cod cakes (bacalhau).
- Tried Ginjinha (cherry liqueur)—cheers!

## 💡 Lisbon Tips

- Wear comfy shoes—those hills are _not_ for the weak.
- Pickpocket alert in tourist areas (watch your phone!).
- Grab sunset at **Miradouro de Santa Catarina**—the view is worth it.
