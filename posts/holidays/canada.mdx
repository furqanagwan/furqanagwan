# Toronto Takeover: Drake’s City, My Adventure

If you wanna know what it’s like to do ALL the “musts” in Toronto, eat like a true Canadian, and end up slightly damp at Niagara Falls, this post is for you.

## 🏙️ First Impressions

Touchdown in Toronto!
City vibes are strong, skyscrapers everywhere, and people are repping Raptors gear like it’s a uniform. Everything feels big, busy, and 100% alive.

## 🗼 CN Tower — Literally Above It All

Had to start at the CN Tower.
Yes, I did the **glass floor** thing. Yes, my legs went full spaghetti. The city looks wild from up there and if you’re not taking at least five selfies… are you even a tourist?

## 🏀 Raptors & ⚾ Blue Jays — Sports Bucket List

**Scotiabank Arena:**
Raptors game was on another level. The energy is unreal—Drake wasn’t there, but I still felt the 6ix vibes. Everyone’s shouting, “Let’s Go Raptors!” every 3 seconds. Even the nachos slap.

**Rogers Centre:**
Caught a Blue Jays game too! Open-roof, summer vibes, and a chill crowd. Tried to catch a foul ball—failed, but did get a sunburn. Worth.

## 🐟 Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada

Got my underwater fix at Ripley’s Aquarium. The jellyfish tunnel is straight out of a dream, and the sharks? Big “nope” energy, but also awesome. Pro tip: The moving walkway is S-tier for tired legs.

## 🍁 Eating Like a Canadian

- **Tim Hortons:**
  Double Double and Timbits are actually addictive. Canadians are built different.
- **IHOP:**
  Had to compare pancakes. Verdict: good, but I still prefer my own.
- **Poutine:**
  Fries, gravy, cheese curds. Enough said.
- **Maple syrup everything:**
  If you leave Canada without OD’ing on maple, did you even go?

## 🌊 Niagara Falls & That Iconic Boat Ride

Okay, Niagara is _not_ technically Toronto but it’s a rite of passage.

- Did the **Hornblower/Maid of the Mist** boat ride right up to the falls—got absolutely drenched. Zero regrets.
- You hear the thunder, you feel the mist, and your phone gets… kinda wet.
- 10/10, nature is wild.

## 🛍️ City Spots — Shopping & Exploring

- **Dundas Square:**
  Toronto’s answer to Times Square. Big screens, lots of energy, random street performers, and a wild crowd.
- **Eaton Centre:**
  Shopping heaven. Grabbed some souvenirs and _way_ too much Raptors merch.
- **Jordan Store:**
  Sneakerhead paradise. Even if you’re not copping, it’s worth the trip for the vibe.

## 😎 Final Thoughts & Hot Tips

- Buy a **PRESTO card** for easy TTC (subway/bus/streetcar) rides.
- Always tip your Tim’s barista (they _know_ if you don’t).
- Don’t skip the neighborhoods—Kensington Market, Queen Street West, and Chinatown are all a vibe.
- Get Raptors or Jays tickets in advance for better seats/prices.
- If you see a squirrel, don’t freak out. Toronto’s full of them.

## 🥞 The Pancake Report

> IHOP in Toronto? Decent. But nothing beats pancakes at home with friends.
> (Canada, step your pancake game up! 😅)

Had the time of my life—10/10, would do it again.
Toronto = world-class city, and now I’ve got the fridge magnets to prove it.
