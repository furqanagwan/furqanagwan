Italy is vibes, pasta, and chaos in the best way. In one trip, I got ancient ruins, floating cities, high fashion, and more carbs than should be legal. Here’s my ultimate trio adventure!

## 🏛️ Rome: Ruins, Gelato & Vespas

**First stop: Rome!**
If you love history, pasta, and big city energy, you’ll fall for the Eternal City.

- **Colosseum:** Stood where gladiators fought, got main character energy.
- **Trevi Fountain:** Threw a coin, made a wish. Also dodged 1,000 selfie sticks.
- **Vatican City:** Art, ceilings, and Michelangelo flexes.
- **Trastevere:** Lost in cobbled lanes, found epic pizza and local vibes.
- **Gelato:** Every day. No regrets.

_City tip: Crosswalks are a suggestion. Watch out for Vespas!_

## 🚤 Venice: Lost in the Maze (And Loving It)

Venice is a literal fever dream. Canals everywhere, bridges every five steps, and Google Maps is basically useless (but that’s the fun).

- **Gondola ride:** Overpriced? Maybe. Worth it? 100%.
- **Piazza San Marco:** Iconic, pigeons included for free.
- **Bacari bars:** Grabbed cicchetti (Venetian tapas) and just people-watched.
- **Getting lost:** It’s the whole point. Every alley is a photo op.
- **Gelato (again):** Venice scoops hit different.

_Fun fact: Vaporetto (water bus) is the pro move for seeing the city without breaking the bank._

## 🏙️ Milan: Style, Sights & Espresso

Final stop: Milan—the fashion and football capital, but with *mad* history and nightlife too.

- **Duomo di Milano:** Climbed to the rooftop—gothic views, lots of selfies.
- **Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II:** Shopped (well, mostly window-shopped).
- **San Siro:** Caught a match. Italians *live* for football.
- **Navigli Canals:** Perfect for sunset and people-watching with aperitivo in hand.
- **Fashion:** Tried to blend in. Failed. Had fun anyway.
- **Risotto alla milanese:** Next level.
- **Espresso:** On every corner—sometimes two per block.

_City tip: Trams and the metro make getting around a breeze. Book big attractions early (especially “The Last Supper”)._

## 😎 Italy Hot Tips

- **Book attractions ahead:** Colosseum, Vatican, Duomo, Last Supper—all get booked up!
- **Cash is handy:** Not every place takes card (especially in Venice).
- **Late nights:** Cities glow after dark—don’t rush home!
- **Eat local:** Pasta, risotto, pizza, gelato… live your best carb life.
- **Wear comfy shoes:** You’ll walk. A lot.

Italy isn’t just a country, it’s a vibe.
History, chaos, fashion, food, and friendly energy everywhere.
Already planning my next trip back!
