This trip covers three of Italy’s most well-known cities—Rome, Venice, and Milan. Each offers something unique, from ancient ruins and iconic art to canal-side walks and modern city life.

## Rome

Rome was the starting point of my trip. The city is filled with historical sites and a lively atmosphere.

- **Colosseum:** Impressive ancient structure and a must-visit for anyone interested in history.
- **Trevi Fountain:** Famous for its beautiful design. Tossing a coin is a tradition for many visitors.
- **Vatican City:** The museums and St. Peter’s Basilica are worth seeing for art and architecture lovers.
- **Trastevere:** A neighborhood known for local restaurants and narrow streets.
- **Gelato:** Plenty of opportunities to try traditional Italian ice cream.

_Note: Pedestrian crossings can be busy, and scooters are common. Stay alert when walking around the city._

## Venice

Venice stands out for its unique layout of canals and bridges. It’s a city best explored on foot or by water.

- **Gondola ride:** A classic experience, though prices can be high.
- **Piazza San Marco:** Central square with historic buildings and frequent gatherings.
- **Bacari bars:** Great places to try local snacks and observe daily life.
- **Exploring side streets:** Getting lost in the narrow alleys often leads to interesting sights.
- **Gelato:** Available throughout the city.

_Tip: Consider using the Vaporetto (water bus) for affordable travel on the canals._

Milan is Italy’s business and fashion center, but also offers history, art, and good food.

- **Duomo di Milano:** Impressive cathedral with the option to climb to the rooftop for city views.
- **Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II:** Historic shopping arcade.
- **San Siro:** Football stadium, recommended for sports fans.
