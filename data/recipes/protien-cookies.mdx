## Ingredients

- **80g** vanilla whey protein  
  _Substitute:_ Any flavoured whey protein (chocolate works well)
- **120g** rolled oats  
  _Substitute:_ Instant oats or oat flour (texture will be softer)
- **60g** plain flour  
  _Substitute:_ Oat flour for gluten-free
- **90g** natural peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)  
  _Substitute:_ Almond butter or cashew butter
- **80g** low-fat Greek yogurt  
  _Substitute:_ Skyr or any thick plain yogurt
- **50g** light brown sugar or coconut sugar  
  _Substitute:_ Sweetener blend (adjust to taste)
- **1** medium egg  
  _Substitute:_ Flax egg (for vegan option; texture will change)
- **1 tsp** baking powder
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract (optional)
- Pinch of salt
- Optional: 30g dark chocolate chips or chopped nuts

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 175°C (155°C fan). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. **Mix wet:** In a large bowl, stir together peanut butter, Greek yogurt, sugar, egg, and vanilla until smooth.
3. **Add dry:** Fold in oats, protein powder, flour, baking powder, salt, and any optional extras.
4. **Shape:** Scoop dough (about 2 heaping tablespoons per cookie) onto tray, flattening each slightly with a spoon.
5. **Bake:** Bake for **10–13 minutes** until edges are lightly golden. Don’t overbake — they firm up as they cool.
6. Let cool on tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
