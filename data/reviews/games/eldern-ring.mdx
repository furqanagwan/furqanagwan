## What Stands Out

- **Freedom to explore:** No forced quest order. You can take on challenges however you want.
- **Atmosphere:** The world is dark, mysterious, and stunning.
- **Combat:** Rewarding and fair—but merciless.
- **Boss design:** Creative, memorable, and sometimes rage-inducing.

## What Could Be Better

- **Difficulty curve:** Brutal for new players.
- **Performance:** Occasional stutters on PC at launch.
- **Storytelling:** Typical FromSoft—mostly told through lore, not cutscenes.

## Final Thoughts

If you like hard games and want a world to lose yourself in, Elden Ring is a must-play. It’s tough, but every victory feels earned.

**My score:** ★★★★½ out of 5
